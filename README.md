## Overview

[The spectre of "fake news" is slowly finding its way into the Ontario political scene, with certain parties controlling questions allowed by the media and by generating their own news outlets so that they can control their message.

Reporters and the companies that own the media have their own political slants that are known and apparent to well-versed readers but not to those who have differing levels of media literacy.

For decades a diversity of opinion and commentary contributed to a robust political climate because, for the most part, the facts were not in dispute - only people's reaction to these facts. But the era of fake news is based on distorting facts and voices, and reporting distortions multiple times so that these distortions of basic facts become truths.

"In their own Voices" aims to allow readers to form their own opinions based on the words that come out of the politicians mouths, without any filters or commentary as their are plenty of other sources for this commentary. Citizens should be able to analyze political messages for themselves and engage in informed conversation with their provincially elected representatives.

How does one get to the politicians words - without filters. We give you the politicians' facebook and twitter feeds and their parliamentary record - their official speeches, votes and news releases. All of this information is available to you in real-time.

For the purpose of this demonstration Members elected from the Ontario Liberal Party will reflect this even though they are not an offical party as they failed to gain the minimum number of seats.  The same reasoning was applied to the Green Party.
